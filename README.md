# TorChat
Chat program that allows users to send messages through the tor network to each other

Messages are send from one chat client to another chat client using an onion-server in between.
Traffic is end to end encrypted in two layers with (yet) AES - post-quantum cryptography (PQC) will be implemented in the future.
